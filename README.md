template
==============================

This template repository contains standardized folder structures and best practices for reproducibility. It is designed to be used as a template when creating a new repository.

The template pre-populates the following important items:

*  MIT License
*  Requirements.txt and setup.py for environment set-up
*  Tox.ini for automated unit tests -- which will be run for each commit by GitHub actions
*  Makefile
*  Folders to remind users to keep data, documentation, references, notebooks, and source files separate.
*  GitHub workflows to build and push Docker images, and to test the Python package installation for CI/CD
*  Automated actions to create a pull request fixing PEP8 Issues

Note:

*  As an Enterprise organization, WRI receives 50,000 free minutes of CI/CD time per month. The CI/CD for this template takes about 6/minutes of time per push.
